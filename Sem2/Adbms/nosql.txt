NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL," is a database management system (DBMS) designed to handle 
large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational 
databases that use tables and pre-defined schemas, NoSQL databases provide flexible 
data models and support horizontal scalability, making them ideal for modern applications 
that require real-time data processing.

Why Use NoSQL?

Unlike relational databases, which uses Structured Query Language, NoSQL databases don't 
have a universal query language. Instead, each type of NoSQL database typically has its 
unique query language. Traditional relational databases follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, 
Isolation, Durability) principles, ensuring strong consistency and structured relationships between data.

However, as applications evolved to handle big data, real-time analytics, and distributed environments, 
NoSQL emerged as a solution with:

    Scalability – Can scale horizontally by adding more nodes instead of upgrading a single machine.
    Flexibility – Supports unstructured or semi-structured data without a rigid schema.
    High Performance – Optimized for fast read/write operations with large datasets.
    Distributed Architecture – Designed for high availability and partition tolerance in distributed systems.

Types of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are generally classified into four main categories based on how they store and retrieve data
1. Document databases

Store data in JSON, BSON, or XML format.

    Data is stored as documents that can contain varying attributes.
    Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cloudant
    Ideal for content management systems, user profiles, and catalogs where flexible schemas are needed.

2. Key-value stores

    Data is stored as key-value pairs, making retrieval extremely fast.
    Optimized for caching and session storage.
    Examples: Redis, Memcached, Amazon DynamoDB
    Perfect for applications requiring session management, real-time data caching, and leaderboards.

3. Column-family stores

    Data is stored in columns rather than rows, enabling high-speed analytics and distributed computing.
    Efficient for handling large-scale data with high write/read demands.
    Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase, Google Bigtable
    Great for time-series data, IoT applications, and big data analytics.

4. Graph databases

    Data is stored as nodes and edges, enabling complex relationship management.
    Best suited for social networks, fraud detection, and recommendation engines.
    Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB
    Useful for applications requiring relationship-based queries such as fraud detection and social network analysis.

Key Features of NoSQL Databases

    Dynamic schema: NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema and can accommodate changing data structures without the need for migrations or schema alterations.
    Horizontal scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by adding more nodes to a database cluster, making them well-suited for handling large amounts of data and high levels of traffic.
    Document-based: Some NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, use a document-based data model, where data is stored in a schema-less semi-structured format, such as JSON or BSON.
    Key-value-based: Other NoSQL databases, such as Redis, use a key-value data model, where data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs.
    Column-based: Some NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra, use a column-based data model, where data is organized into columns instead of rows.
    Distributed and high availability: NoSQL databases are often designed to be highly available and to automatically handle node failures and data replication across multiple nodes in a database cluster.
    Flexibility: NoSQL databases allow developers to store and retrieve data in a flexible and dynamic manner, with support for multiple data types and changing data structures.
    Performance: NoSQL databases are optimized for high performance and can handle a high volume of reads and writes, making them suitable for big data and real-time applications.

Advantages of NoSQL

There are many advantages of working with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra. The main advantages are high scalability and high availability.

    High scalability: NoSQL databases use sharding for horizontal scaling. Partitioning of data and placing it on multiple machines in such a way 
    that the order of the data is preserved is sharding. Vertical scaling means adding more resources to the existing machine whereas horizontal scaling means adding more machines to handle the data. 
    Vertical scaling is not that easy to implement but horizontal scaling is easy to implement. Examples of horizontal scaling databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, etc. NoSQL can handle a huge amount of 
    data because of scalability, as the data grows NoSQL scalesThe auto itself to handle that data in an efficient manner.
    
    Flexibility: NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, which means that they can accommodate dynamic changes to the data model. 
    This makes NoSQL databases a good fit for applications that need to handle changing data requirements.
    High availability: The auto, replication feature in NoSQL databases makes it highly available because in case of any failure data replicates itself to the previous consistent state.
    
    Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable, which means that they can handle large amounts of data and traffic with ease. This makes them a good fit for applications that need to 
    handle large amounts of data or traffic
    
    Performance: NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and traffic, which means that they can offer improved performance compared to traditional relational databases.
    Cost-effectiveness: NoSQL databases are often more cost-effective than traditional relational databases, as they are typically less complex and do not require expensive hardware or software.
    
    Agility: Ideal for agile development.

Disadvantages of NoSQL

    Lack of standardization:  There are many different types of NoSQL databases, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. This lack of standardization can make it difficult to choose the right database for a specific application
    Lack of ACID compliance: NoSQL databases are not fully ACID-compliant, which means that they do not guarantee the consistency, integrity, and durability of data. This can be a drawback for applications that require strong data consistency guarantees.
    Narrow focus: NoSQL databases have a very narrow focus as it is mainly designed for storage but it provides very little functionality. Relational databases are a better choice in the field of Transaction Management than NoSQL.
    Open-source: NoSQL is an databaseopen-source database. There is no reliable standard for NoSQL yet. In other words, two database systems are likely to be unequal.
    Lack of support for complex queries: NoSQL databases are not designed to handle complex queries, which means that they are not a good fit for applications that require complex data analysis or reporting.
    Lack of maturity: NoSQL databases are relatively new and lack the maturity of traditional relational databases. This can make them less reliable and less secure than traditional databases.
    Management challenge: The purpose of big data tools is to make the management of a large amount of data as simple as possible. But it is not so easy. Data management in NoSQL is much more complex than in a relational database.
    NoSQL, in particular, has a reputation for being challenging to install and even more hectic to manage on a daily basis.
    GUI is not available: GUI mode tools to access the database are not flexibly available in the market.
    Backup: Backup is a great weak point for some NoSQL databases like MongoDB. MongoDB has no approach for the backup of data in a consistent manner.
    Large document size: Some database systems like MongoDB and CouchDB store data in JSON format. This means that documents are quite large (BigData, network bandwidth, speed), and having descriptive key names actually hurts since they increase the document size.

Use a NoSQL database when:

    Data is unstructured or semi-structured and needs a flexible schema.
    We require high scalability and must handle large datasets.
    Performance is critical for real-time applications.
    The application needs to handle distributed workloads efficiently.
    We don’t require strict ACID transactions, but prioritize availability and speed
