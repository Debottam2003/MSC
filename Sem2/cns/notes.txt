Cryptography
------------

The transformation of plain text to cipher text and cipher text to plain text back.

Types:
1. Symetric Key : Both encription and decription is done by a single key 🔑.
2. Asymetric Key : Encryption and decryption is done by two different keys 🔑 + 🗝️.

Key Terms: Key, Plain text, Cipher text, Cipher, Cryptography, Cryptanalysis, Cryptology

Types of Attacking approaches
1. Cryptanalysis Attack
Type of Attack         |       Known to cryptanalyst 
--------------         |       ---------------------
Cipher text only       |       Encryption Algorithm and Cipher text
2. Brute Force Attck / guessing attack / exhaustive key search
