Coupling and Cohesion
Cohesion, refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities
of a single module or class are.High Cohesion means a class or module performs
a single task or a group of related tasks, which makes the system easier to maintain and understand.

Coupling, refers to the degree of direct knowledge one class has about another.
Low coupling is preferred as it means changes in one module are less likely to affect others,
prompting independence and easier maintainance.
