Coupling and Cohesion
Cohesion, refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities
of a single module or class are.High Cohesion means a class or module performs
a single task or a group of related tasks, which makes the system easier to maintain and understand.

Coupling, refers to the degree of direct knowledge one class has about another.
Low coupling is preferred as it means changes in one module are less likely to affect others,
prompting independence and easier maintainance.

Modularity and Hierarchy

    Modularity is about dividing a system into distinct modules or components, 
    each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. 
    This helps in managing complexity and enhances reusability and maintainability.

    Hierarchy involves organizing modules or classes into layers where higher-level 
    classes use lower-level classes. Common forms of hierarchy in OOP include inheritance 
    hierarchies where classes are arranged in parent-child relationships.
