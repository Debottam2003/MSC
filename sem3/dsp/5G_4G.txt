For 20 MHz LTE:

Subcarrier spacing = 15 kHz

Effective bandwidth ≈ 18 MHz (after guard bands)

18MHz/15kHz≈1200 subcarriers

➡️ That’s 1200 data channels in parallel

1 subcarrier = very low data rate (few kbps)

A typical user might use 100+ subcarriers at a time

So with 1200 total:

If every user needs 100 → about 12 users at max speed

Why higher frequency has poor range?
Higher frequency⇒Shorter wavelength

Shorter wavelength:

Gets absorbed more by buildings, trees, air

Cannot bend around obstacles well

Needs many more towers / small cells

Example Approx:

| Band      | Wavelength | Coverage   | Use                |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 700 MHz   | ~40 cm     | Large area | Rural LTE/5G       |
| 3.5 GHz   | ~8 cm      | Medium     | 5G sub-6 (cities)  |
| 26–28 GHz | ~1 cm      | Very short | 5G mmWave hotspots |

📡 Bandwidth → Subcarriers → Speed
Example:

| Spectrum              | Bandwidth           | Subcarriers  |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 20 MHz (4G LTE)       | ~1200 subcarriers   | Few 100 Mbps |
| 100 MHz (5G mid band) | ~6000 subcarriers   | 1–3 Gbps     |
| 1 GHz (5G mmWave)     | ~60,000 subcarriers | 5–10+ Gbps   |

| Band               | Example     | Speed        | Range         | Notes           |

| Low-band           | 700–900 MHz | 🐢 Low       | 🟢 Long       | Rural coverage  |
| Mid-band           | 2.3–3.5 GHz | ⚡ Fast       | 🟡 Medium     | Best 5G balance |

When you select a Wi-Fi channel (e.g., channel 6 in the 2.4 GHz band), 
you are designating a specific set of frequencies for your data transmission. 
The center frequency for channel 6 is 2.437 GHz (or 2437 MHz).
The 20 MHz bandwidth means your signal occupies the frequencies from approximately 2.427 GHz up to 2.447 GHz 
(i.e., 10 MHz below to 10 MHz above the center).

If the system is designed to vary the signal across a 20 MHz range 
(e.g., between 2.427 GHz and 2.447 GHz), its bandwidth is 20 MHz.

If the system varies the signal across a 40 MHz range, its bandwidth is 40 MHz, 
allowing for faster variations and thus more data.

The signal begins operating precisely at 2.427 GHz (the bottom edge of the window).
It simultaneously uses every frequency up to 2.447 GHz (the top edge of the window).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Phone Generates a Signal: Your phone modulates data onto an entirely different carrier frequency (e.g., 2.1 GHz).
It Uses Bandwidth: Just like the tower, your phone uses a specific bandwidth (e.g., 20 MHz wide) to transmit its signal, which again contains many subcarriers.
Simultaneous Operation: Because the uplink and downlink are using separate frequencies, they can both transmit at the same time without interfering with each other. 
This is called Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD).

Here are 5 key reasons why systems like 4G LTE do not use 10,000 narrow 2 kHz subcarriers 
instead of the standard 1200 wider 15 kHz subcarriers:

Reasons Not to Use Very Narrow Subcarriers:

Increased Processing Power Requirements: Managing 10,000 separate frequencies simultaneously 
requires significantly more complex hardware and processing power in both the cell tower and 
your mobile device, making the devices more expensive and less efficient.

Higher Signaling Overhead: More narrow subcarriers mean more management data (control signaling) 
needs to be sent just to tell every device which frequency to use. This "overhead" takes up valuable 
bandwidth, reducing the space available for the actual user data.
    
Vulnerability to the Doppler Effect (Movement): Narrow subcarriers are extremely sensitive to frequency 
shifts caused by movement. If you are in a moving car, the slight shift in the wave frequency would cause 
adjacent narrow subcarriers to overlap, leading to significant interference and dropped data.

Susceptibility to Phase Noise: Internal electronic noise within the router or phone itself 
(called phase noise) affects narrow signals more severely. The wider 15 kHz spacing is more 
robust and tolerant of this inherent electronic noise.
   
Lack of Standardization: Wireless standards like 4G LTE rely on universally agreed-upon parameters 
(like 15 kHz spacing) so that any phone can talk to any tower. Changing this fundamental parameter 
would break global interoperability.

User1 and User2 are hit by the same radio waves,
but only the intended device with valid keys can process the data.

Every devices are strucked by the radio waves but it only handle the radio waves that are meant for that device.
