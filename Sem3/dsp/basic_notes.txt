Amplitude:
----------
Maximum height above or below from the mean position.
Unit: SI unit meter

Wave Length:
------------
Wavelength (λ) is the distance between two consecutive peaks (or troughs) of the wave.
A single air particle's oscillation gives you an A vs. T graph (Amplitude vs. Time).
When you look at multiple particles across space, you can create a wave and measure the distance between similar oscillations (like from peak to peak).
This distance is the wavelength.

Frequency:
----------
How many oscillations the particle completes in one second.

Period:
-------
The period (T) is the time it takes for the particle to complete one full oscillation (back and forth).

v = f * 𝜆	​
Where:
λ = wavelength (meters)
v = wave speed (m/s)
f = frequency (Hz)

Bandwidth:
----------
Bandwidth is commonly used to refer to the maximum rate at which data can be sent or received over a network.
