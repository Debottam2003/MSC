✔️ DIANA – Simple Step-by-Step Algorithm

1️⃣ Start with all objects in one cluster.

2️⃣ Select the object with the largest average distance to all others.
→ This object starts a new splinter cluster S.

3️⃣ Put all other objects into the remainder cluster R.

4️⃣ For each object in R:

Compare how close it is to R vs. to S.

If the object is more similar to S than to R,
→ Move it from R → S.

5️⃣ Repeat Step 4 until no more objects want to move.

6️⃣ Now you have two clusters: S and R.
→ This is the split for this level.

7️⃣ Apply DIANA again (recursively) to each cluster with more than 1 object:

Repeat steps 2–6 independently on S

Repeat steps 2–6 independently on R

8️⃣ Continue until all clusters contain one object (or desired number of clusters reached).

🔍 Quick Summary in One Line

Always find the most dissimilar item, let it form a new group, then keep moving items into that group if they fit better there — repeat for each resulting subgroup.
